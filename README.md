Boom  	
====

This is Boom, a boilerplate I developed for quick and simple prototyping within the browser.

This is far from perfect - I developed it at a hackathon, and I feel that until all loopholes have been closed, it's use should be limited to quick proyotyping.
Say you're at a hackathon and you're running out of time. You need to whip up a responsive front-end quickly, just for the sake of displaying your project, or showing off and saying - "Hey you - this project, yeah, IT FITS." 
Or, say, you need to show a customer who's going to hire you how their website will scale/contract when seen on a web browser or a mobile browser - Enter Boom, the friendly boilerplate meant for prototyping.

Feel free to use and modify, and build upon this as you think fit - A mention in your project documentation, however, would be really awesome.

Use it well!
